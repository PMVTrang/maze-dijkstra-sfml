- C++ has
    + std::list ~ doubly linked list. Keep track of size.
    + std::forward_list ~ singly linked list. Doesnt keep track of size.
    Rumor has the forward_list contains NO space or time overhead compared to a user defined singly linked list
- list ~ linkedlist: element storage not contiguous. Insert, delete faster -> add new pointer
  vector ~ array: elements in contiguous memory. Insert, delete -> shift elements by one
- emplace_back() vs push_back() ???
    + emplace doesnt create a temporary (unnecessary) copies while push does
    + more ???
